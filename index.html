									<h2> Who am I</h2>
									<p style="text-align:justify;"> Hello, my name is Gabriel Henrique Linke and I'm in my third semester of graduation in the computer engineering course at UTFPR. I'm passionate about programming
										and I try to improve my skills through practice and also by learning new programming languages.
										I currently have projects developed in C, C++ and Java, beyond Web projects developed with HTML, CSS, Javascript and Typescript, being used ReactJS and Node.js in some of them.
										I also enjoy working with hardware, although I still don't have much experience in that area.</p>

										<h2>Lemurya: <br>A platform game</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/Lemurya.JPG" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This is a platform game developed in the second semester of graduation, using the SFML graphics library, as the final project of the subject Técnicas de Programação.
										The main purpose of this project was learning software engineering techniques, especially object-oriented programming in C++. 
										It was performed a development that took into
										account the usual concepts of object orientation such as Class, Object and Relationship, as well as some
										advanced concepts like Abstract Class, Polymorphism, Templates, file object persistence and Standard Template Library – STL. 
										The code and the report are available on Github.

										<h2>Water Consumption Meter (WCM)</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/MCA.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This is a project that was made at the third semester of graduation, for the subject of 
										Oficina de Integração 1. Its objective is to make available to the user the amount of water ingested during the day.
										For this purpose, a water dispenser was created with a water flow sensor inside it. This sensor is
										connected to an Arduino microcontroller that compute the water volume that has passed through
										the sensor. Thus, the data can be made available via bluetooth for an Android application.
										It was necessary to work with hardware, in addition to having to program in C and Java.
										The code and the report are available on Github.</p>

										<h2>Ecoleta</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/NLW1.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										This project was developed during the Next Level Week #1, carried out by Rocketseat.
										It consists of a web application developed with Node.js, Express, SQLite and Nunjucks, in addition to HTML and CSS.
										In this application, there is a home page with a collect point register button, which redirects the user to a page with a registration form.
										Moreover, there is also a search button, which allows you to search the collection points registered in each city.
										The code is available on Github.
