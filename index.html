									<h2> Who am I</h2>
									<p style="text-align:justify;"> Hello, my name is Gabriel Henrique Linke and I'm in my fourth 
										semester of graduation in the computer engineering course at UTFPR. I'm passionate about programming
										and I try to improve my skills through practice and also by learning new programming languages.
										I currently have projects developed in C, C++ and Java, beyond Web and Mobile projects developed with 
										HTML, CSS, Javascript and Typescript, with technologies such as ReactJS, React native and Node.js being used in some of them.
										I also enjoy working with hardware, although I still don't have much experience in that area.
									</p>
									<p style="text-align:justify;">
										I still have no professional experience, however, I've already worked for a semester as a university monitor 
										of the subject of Analytical Geometry and Linear Algebra, besides currently being part of the programming team of 
										the NÓS - Nosso Olhar Solidário project.
									</p>

									<p>
										This is an UTFPR extension project, where we combine technology, affection and purpose in a non-profit app. 
										Our mission is to be a bond between those who want to help and those who want help. For this, we disclose solidarity 
										actions and its needs for products and voluntary services without involving any kind of commercial transaction,
										so that people willing to donate and help a cause easily find entities that are in need of this help and manage 
										to carry out their actions without intermediaries. Currently the app is available on Play Store and App Store 
										under the name Nosso Olhar Solidário. At this time it is not yet possible to make donations through the website,
										however, this option will be added in the future. More information can be obtained on the project's 
										<a href="https://linkme.bio/nos-app/">social networks</a> or on the website.

										<h2>Lemurya: <br>A platform game</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/Lemurya.JPG" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This is a platform game developed in the second semester of graduation, using the SFML graphics library, as the final project of the subject Técnicas de Programação.
										The main purpose of this project was learning software engineering techniques, especially object-oriented programming in C++. 
										It was performed a development that took into
										account the usual concepts of object orientation such as Class, Object and Relationship, as well as some
										advanced concepts like Abstract Class, Polymorphism, Templates, file object persistence and Standard Template Library – STL. 
										The code and the report are available on Github.

										<h2>Water Consumption Meter (WCM)</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/MCA.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This is a project that was made at the third semester of graduation, for the subject of 
										Oficina de Integração 1. Its objective is to make available to the user the amount of water ingested during the day.
										For this purpose, a water dispenser was created with a water flow sensor inside it. This sensor is
										connected to an Arduino microcontroller that compute the water volume that has passed through
										the sensor. Thus, the data can be made available via bluetooth for an Android application.
										It was necessary to work with hardware, in addition to having to program in C and Java.
										The code and the report are available on Github.</p>

										<h2>Proffy</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/proffy.png" alt="Imagem da página inicial do Proffy" /></a>
									<p>	This project was developed during the Next Level Week #2, carried out by Rocketseat.
										Proffy is a Web and Mobile application designed to help connect students and teachers. 
										Therefore, this application offers teachers the possibility to register classes, being able to add 
										information such as discipline, cost and schedule. It also offers students the possibility to search for registered classes.
										For its development, technologies such as ReactJS, React Native, Node.js and Typescript were used.
										The code is available on Github.

									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/lendo-musica.png" alt="Imagem da página inicial do Lendo Música" /></a>
									<p>	
										Lendo Música is a lyrics search engine with Web and Mobile versions. Its use is very simple:
										the user just has to enter the name of the author of the song and the name of the song and press the search 
										button to be able to access the lyrics of the song. In addition, it is also possible to access the search history.
										The Mobile version of this project was developed as a final project for the formation of programmers from the team 
										of the NÓS app, while the Web version was developed with the intention of practicing ReactJS. 
										For its development, technologies such as ReactJS, React Native and Javascript were used.
										The code is available on Github.
